## Submissions

- [Putting Parties out to Pasture: Pastoralist Clans and the Development of Party Systems](https://github.com/tliptrot/author2/blob/master/_publications/2025-1-7-Parties-2-Pasture-Tim-Liptrot.pdf?raw=true). Manuscript submitted for publication in *American Political Science Review*.
  - This paper applies a historic political economy lens to the origin of political parties. I find that states with histories of pastoralism are less likely to develop party systems because they inherit clan institutions, which are substitutes for authoritarian parties.
  
- [Borrowed Credibility: Sovereign Default and Technocrat Finance Ministers in Autocracies](https://github.com/tliptrot/author2/blob/master/_publications/2025-1-7-Borrowed-Credibility-Tim-Liptrot.pdf?raw=true). Manuscript submitted for publication in *Review of International Organizations*.
  - This paper investigates how autocrats signal commitment to their sovereign creditors during default. I show that defaulting autocrats are more likely to appoint a politically independent technocrat as finance minister.

- [Personalist Property: Autocratic Leader Turnover and Property Rights](https://github.com/tliptrot/author2/blob/master/_publications/2025-1-7-Personalist-Property-Tim-Liptrot.pdf?raw=true) Manuscript submitted for publication in *Economics and Politics
  - Examines the durability of property rights over leadership successions in different types of autocracies. I find that leader death is associated with FDI expropriation in personalist autocracies but not other regime types.
