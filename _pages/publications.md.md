## Publications

- **"Borrowed Credibility"**: This paper investigates how autocrats signal commitment to their sovereign creditors during default. I show that defaulting autocrats are more likely to appoint a politically independent technocrat as finance minister.
- **"Parties to Pasture"**: This paper applies a historic political economy lens to the origin of political parties. I find that states with histories of pastoralism are less likely to develop party systems because they inherit clan institutions, which are substitutes for authoritarian parties.
