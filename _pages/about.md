I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Georgetown University . I study comparative politics, specializing in power sharing in authoritarian regimes. My work deals with how autocrats choose cabinet ministers, expropriation, and the origin of authoritarian institutions.

My JMP for political science roles is  [Putting Parties out to Pasture: Pastoralist Clans and the Development of Party Systems](https://github.com/tliptrot/author2/blob/master/_publications/2025-1-7-Parties-2-Pasture-Tim-Liptrot.pdf?raw=true). This paper applies a historic political economy lens to the origin of political parties in autocratic states. I argue that party systems were less likely to develop when both autocrats and citizens had an alternative institution: the kin-ship network or clan. I find that pastoralist societies, which tend to have stronger clan institutions, are more likely to have no or weak political parties. I test the result with a combination of case studies and cross-national regressions.
  
My JMP for business and public policy roles is [Borrowed Credibility: Sovereign Default and Technocrat Finance Ministers in Autocracies](https://github.com/tliptrot/author2/blob/master/_publications/2025-1-7-Borrowed-Credibility-Tim-Liptrot.pdf?raw=true). This paper investigates how autocrats signal commitment to their sovereign creditors during default. I propose that appointing as finance minister an independent technocrat who is close to creditors (IFI workers, bankers or academics) as a strategy. I show that autocrats indeed appoint independent technocrats more often during defaults.

I am also publish policy papers which apply political science results to real world policy problems. I published a [piece in War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2024/10/how-to-sanction-sudan-without-creating-a-failed-state/) on the how sanctions can be used to reduce war crimes committed in the 2023 Sudanese war. My [analysis with the Al Jazeer Center](https://studies.aljazeera.net/en/analyses/iraq-must-compromise-between-majoritarianism-and-consensus-government-formation) proposes reforms to the Iraqi cabinet formation process to introduce more electoral competition. Two of my papers in the publication section inform humanitarian actors on best practices for working in neighborhoods with multiple competing public authorities.
