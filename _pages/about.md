I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Georgetown University . I studying comparative politics, specializing in power sharing in authoritarian regimes. My work deals with how autocrats choose cabinet ministers, expropriation, and the origin of authoritarian institutions.

I am also publish policy papers which apply political science results to real world policy problems. I published a [piece in War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2024/10/how-to-sanction-sudan-without-creating-a-failed-state/) on the how sanctions can be used to reduce war crimes committed in the 2023 Sudanese war. My [analysis with the Al Jazeer Center](https://studies.aljazeera.net/en/analyses/iraq-must-compromise-between-majoritarianism-and-consensus-government-formation) proposes reforms to the Iraqi cabinet formation process to introduce more electoral competition. Two of my papers in the publication section inform humanitarian actors on best practices for working in neighborhoods with multiple competing public authorities.


- My paper "Borrowed Credibility" investigates how autocrats signal commitment o their sovereign creditors during default. I show that defaulting autocrats are more likely to appoint a politcially independent technocrat as finance minister.
- My paper "Parties to Pasture" applies a historic political economy lense to the origin of political parties. I find that states with histories of pastoralism are less likely to develop party systems because they inherit clan institutions, which are subsitutes for authoritarian parties.
