I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Georgetown University . I study comparative politics, specializing in power sharing in authoritarian regimes. My work deals with how autocrats choose cabinet ministers, expropriation, and the origin of authoritarian institutions.

I am also publish policy papers which apply political science results to real world policy problems. I published a [piece in War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2024/10/how-to-sanction-sudan-without-creating-a-failed-state/) on the how sanctions can be used to reduce war crimes committed in the 2023 Sudanese war. My [analysis with the Al Jazeer Center](https://studies.aljazeera.net/en/analyses/iraq-must-compromise-between-majoritarianism-and-consensus-government-formation) proposes reforms to the Iraqi cabinet formation process to introduce more electoral competition. Two of my papers in the publication section inform humanitarian actors on best practices for working in neighborhoods with multiple competing public authorities.
